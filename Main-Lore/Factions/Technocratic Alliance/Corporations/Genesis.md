## About
Genesis is a conglomerate formed by three Pre-Exodus companies, [[Mining Company]], [[Construction Company]], and [[Transportation Company]]. The original goal of Genesis was to provide colonization services to the various industry leaders within the Technocratic Alliance. Genesis was a profitable endeavor but due to its niche, its services could never hope to compete economically with other large companies within the Technocratic Alliance.

## During The Exodus
When [[The Exodus]] occurred, Genesis responded quickly by manufacturing Patented "Genesis Brand World Ships". These World Ships were designed to sustain a colony of humans for multiple generations, allowing those lucky humans to resettle a new world. Genesis would take advantage of the chaos, as well as their position as the saviors of humanity to seize control of the Technocratic alliance and turn the new resettled Technocratic Alliance into a corporatized oligarchy.
