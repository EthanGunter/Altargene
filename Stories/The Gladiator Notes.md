Premise: Being a gladiator in the Arena, and getting caught in all the Family politics that plague it 

Being a gladiator is not about winning the games. It never was. not really.
Yes, there are prizes for victory, and yes the masses find themselves lost in the entirely ethical bloodshed, but few remember why the arena was created. Only the powerful few use it as it was intended.
Gladiators who have sponsors are rare, and the conditions of their service vary, but their objective remains the same: become the ultimate specimen. The Arena is a training grounds for the secret police, the special ops, the bumps in the night that you weren't supposed to hear in the first place. Each match, each encounter, each cheer igniting execution, and each limb lost is a modest contribution towards absolute intuitive and tactical perfection. It's not for show mind you. The real work for these performers begins when the curtains are pulled and the stage lights dim, because in the dark, no one can see you strike.

*Ultimately the arena is a training ground for the political houses to prepare their pawns for missions where negotiations may require a little more... aggression*

### Technologies
- Before a match, each combatant must go through a screening process which utilizes the Cloud (nanobots) to map every cell of their body
	- When combatants are killed, each cell of a wound is able to be reconstructed and reorganized to the state that they were in before their death (using stem-cells and rapid growth agents). This allows combatants to die and be revived, while still gaining benefits from the engagement. At least in the parts of their body that doesn't need to be reconstructed.
	- Headshots are extremely important to sponsors who don't want their opponents to gain an experiential edge during matches. They are technically illegal, but removal from a match is often preferable to the opposition learning a powerful new skill.
	- Weaponry that results in complete obliteration (and an inability to reconstruct the victim) are illegal, but the line that defines "complete obliteration" is heavily blurred, and those with the more money tend to have the luxury of exploiting this fact.
