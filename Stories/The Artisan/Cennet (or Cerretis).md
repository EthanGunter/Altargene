Cennet is Turkish for Paradise.
Cennet is *not* a paradise.

## Geography
- Cennet is covered by large pockets of desert scattered amidst a spaghetti of lush, alien jungles painted in place by massive roving storms.
- The storms are highly toxic to human life forms which give the jungles, and their inhabitants, a distinctly alien appearance.
- The storms tend to follow the same wind currents, and leave the centers of the deserts relatively safe from acid baths, save for the occasional anomaly.
- Due to the circulating nature of these storms, the jungles have seasons of growth and wilting. This is a major plot point for Siel on her quest.
- *Is the rain a naturally occurring phenomenon, or are the rains seeded with acid to control the populace? The creatures, and the planet at large, an experiment of the Auspexian elites?*

## Major (known) Settlements
**Dusthaven**
- The oldest settlement on Cennet, and Siel's home.
- Overpopulated, and pressed to its geographical limits, it has little room to expand.
- Slums are found dangerously close to the storm's path, never really having time to be rebuilt before they get dissolved once again.
- "It's a small city, as far as cities go. Atop a few of the skyscrapers you can even see where the buildings stop and the wilderness begins"
		- *It's certainly not small, but the other near-ecumenopli settlements in the star system dwarf it*
- **Arridopolis**
- **Stormshield**
- **Nomads**
	- While not a *settlement*, there is a smattering of peoples who prefer to take their chances in the wake of the storms. They hunt and gather from the bloom that comes after the showers, and are constantly on the move to stay ahead of the next downpouring.
	- Nomads are incredibly resourceful, able to keep only what they can carry, and this tends to make them opportunistic omnivores. They appear very hostile to more settled people groups. *It's probably worth comparing them to the Fremen of Arrakis*.
	- Are they a branch of humans? Are they natives? Are they hybrids? Who knows, but they seem human enough...
## Wild Life
- Life in the desert is similar to other desert life: small, waxy, reservoirous plant life, and tiny rodents and insects
- In the jungle, life either has a slimy, bacteria-laden outer coating, and/or metallic plating to protect from the rain. Later iterations gradually shed the armoring in favor of staying in perpetual movement ahead of the brunt of the storms
