1. We meet the family and find out that their [[Setting#Condensers|water condenser]] shop is failing, and that Grandpa is growing increasingly disabled due to some unclear illness.
2. While Siel is out shopping, she finds out that the stabilizers that Grandpa needs are becoming unaffordable, and there's a new off-world condenser company that is likely going to put theirs out of business.
3. After stealing and dissecting one of the new condensers, Siel decides she only has one option left: venture into the deadly jungles to find the %LEGENDARY_MATERIAL% that will put their shop back on the map
4. During dinner, Jaeson hears Siel explaining the situation, and her plan to go into the jungle. She puts him in charge of some *very* mundane things, but he isn't one to sit idly. Thinking Grandpa can take care of himself, Jaeson makes his own declaration to go into the city and find a way to help.
5. Siel gathers the things she needs from a local dealer, gets a ride into the outer-city, hires some guides, and ventures into the jungle
6. Siel's guides try to run their scam, but upon finding out that she has no more money, give up the fa√ßade and attempt to rob her instead. She unintentionally uses [[Setting#Aestheturgy|aestheturgy]] and escapes into the jungle by her lonesome
7. Siel gets captured by Altus and imprisoned by him. After some questioning, he promises to nurse her back to health, and demands that she return to the city as soon as she is physically able, but Siel has no intention of returning to the city without the macguffin material
8. During her time being healed, Siel's fear shifts to curiosity as whimsical contraptions bring her meals and all the water she could possibly want. She learns about Altus' fear/distaste for the city, and begin to discover his philosophy 
9. Siel takes advantage of her time observing and her cunning to get out of the cage she's in. As she is sneaking around the compound she witnesses Altus using [[Setting#Aestheturgy|aestheturgy]] and grows very curious. 
	10. Something in one of the machines around Siel reminds her of a mechanism that makes their condensers work, and imagines how it could be used to break out of the cage. She captures and dismantles one of the machines and repurposes it in a way that ultimately inspires Altus to teach her
10. ------- ?? Siel learns from Altus ?? -------
	1. I have no idea what this looks like or how long it should take...
1. Altus reveals his part in controlling the city to Siel, and he accidentally reveals the [[Setting#Junglebane Mushroom|simple cure]] for the [[Setting#Neurotoxin|poison]] that is affecting Grandpa
	1. Altus' design for the [[Setting#The Shield Wall|Atmos-Gates]] has a devastating effect on the nervous system, rendering manual motor functions largely useless
	2. "You should not always be proud of what the sleeping mind is willing to create"
	3. "But those are illega..." Realization forced Siel to take a rapid and unnatural seat. "Oh no... No, you... How could you do something like this!?"
2. Siel angrily, and prematurely, leaves Altus and his teachings behind and returns to the city to give Grandpa the [[Setting#Junglebane Mushroom|junglebane]].
3. Altus has returned to the city to help those in the outer edge. Jaeson unknowingly runs into him during one of his "missions" (so we know what he's doing, so we aren't surprised when he comes to aid at the end, and so we don't feel as angry when he shows back up)
4. Siel has a big encounter and nearly fails, but gets bailed out by some anonymous person somehow
5. Jaeson encounters Siel during one of her big moments. At first he's afraid of being caught by Siel, and starts to plan an escape route, but he quickly discovers that Siel really needs his help. He decides to help from out of sight, and saves her in just the nick of time
6. With her biggest troubles gone, Siel returns to the house and starts putting her new-found knowledge to the test (making a new and improved condenser for the family to sell)
7. Jaeson comes rushing home in tears and he and Siel share a confused glance
	1. Siel doesn't know what Jaeson has to be concerned about, and Jaeson doesn't know that Siel knows he hasn't been home
	2. Jaeson thinks he's in big trouble so he just dumps everything that he's gotten into
8. Siel seemingly ignores him and finishes the condenser. As Jaeson stands there, bewildered and teary eyed, his tears begin to lift off his face and dance around the new condenser
9. Siel gives Jaeson enough money to pay off his debt, and a little bit extra to spend. Jaeson uses the extra money to start his own mission to save the world
