Style changes the way a reader engages with what's happening.

**Magical Elements**: very poetic, approaching literary description of motion and thoughts, the two intertwined. Littered with high-metaphors.
**Mentally/Emotionally Intense Moments**: (mostly covering fear and anxiety) Wordy internal monologues to fill the space of what would take moments. Express all of the character's worst-case-scenarios as each interaction evolves.
**The Remainder**: Straight, play-by-play action. Snappy dialogue, purely functional descriptions. This creates a space for emotionally intense moments to have sizeable impact, and for Aesthetics to have a magical feel for what might otherwise come across as truly mundane.
