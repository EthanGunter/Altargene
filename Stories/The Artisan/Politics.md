# Factions
## [[The Technocratic Alliance]]
The biggest player in The Artisan, the Technos' trading policy and fabrication efficiency are what put the pressure on [[Siel Kunstenaar]] to find a better solution to her family's condenser.
# Planetary Concerns
- Water is nigh sacred on [[Cennet (or Cerretis)]]
	- while not treated as money directly, great cisterns in the city are heavily guarded, and owning a private water storage is a sign of great wealth
- Siel eventually discovers a way to put up powerful barriers that filter storm rains into viable water for humans. This doubles as protection for the extremities of settlements as well as a consistent and abundant source of water for everyone. Someone doesn't want this to happen, for power/control reasons. (Though it shouldn't be introduced in book one)
