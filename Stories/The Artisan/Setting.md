## Technology
##### Condensers: 
- Siel's family makes water condensers that coax water from the toxic jungles into ingestible basins. These condensers are necessary for survival on the inhospitable planet Cerretis.
	- There is a special item/material that legend holds will make their craft perfect. Siel's catalyst quest is to find this item/material
##### The Shield Wall: 
- Altname: Atmos-Gate(s)
- A defensive array of specialized water filters that line the outer rim of the city, preventing the toxic moisture from the jungles from entering the city.
	- It is not a perfect system, and the outer edges of the city still get considerable exposure to rains when the nearby storms are at their peak.
##### Neurotoxin:
- An artificial neurotoxin that gets infused with the incoming moisture that passes through **The Shield Wall**. The Neurotoxin drives those exposed into a near catatonic state, slowly degrading their manual motor functions as they achieve saturation.
	- Designed to keep people from wandering away from the city, the Neurotoxin makes the acidic jungle appear *far* more dangerous than it actually is. Some consider this to be [[Altus]]' greatest achievement; He considers it his greatest failure.
##### Junglebane Mushroom:
- A natural remedy to the **%NEUROTOXIN%**. It only grows in the jungles of [[Cennet (or Cerretis)|Cerretis]], and is expressly illegal in the city under the pretense of being a dangerous hallucinogen.
	- To reinforce this, the upper-city poisons shipments of these mushrooms and hires dirty hands to distribute them amongst the outer city. The gang that [[Jaeson Kunstenaar|Jaeson]] ends up joining is one such band of operatives.
	- ?? I'm not completely sold on this plot point. It seems redundant to poison a population that's already systematically poisoned by the wall. It's also the *literal cure* for the poisoning happening by the wall. Double redundancy just seems overkill... Maybe there is a look-a-like mushroom that *is* poisonous?
##### Stablizers:
- A pharmaceutical extract of the [[#Junglebane Mushroom]] that is laughably cheap easy to produce, is in fact legal (if you have the city's blessing), and outrageously expensive for the people that need it.

## Magic
##### Aestheturgy: 
- alt-name: aesthemancy
- a form of magic that is entirely based around the generation of art. It is a very personal and introspective form of magic that relies on the user to dive into the depths of who they are as a power source. Artwork is the physical manifestation of this magic, and is used as a sort of foci to channel that inner power into the world.
	- **Aesthete**: is derived from the Greek word “Aisthētikos”, meaning perception by the senses or sensitive to beauty.
		- Part of the function *is* the form. Artifacts are not merely a tool, but an integrated part of an environment's identity.
	- **Urgy**: This suffix is from the Greek “Ergon”, meaning work
		- "Just because it's magic, doesn't mean it isn't hard work!"
		- Built on the philosophy that artwork is 10% inspiration/luck, 90% persperation
