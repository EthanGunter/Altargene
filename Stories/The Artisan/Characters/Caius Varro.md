Caius Varro is a mirror image of Jaeson's character, but if he followed his intellect rather than his heart. Creative, charismatic, excitable and idealistic. I want Caius' surface level idealism to be what captures Jaeson's adoration, but with time he finds that Caius' approach to solving things has been heavily tainted by the concessions of reality, and a bitterness of rejection. He grew up in the outer city, but spent most his time as a child running around the inner city, blending in and playing with the wealthier children. He formed a tight friendship with one of those boys, and with time became a close family friend. His wit spun a back story that explains why his parents are never around, yet allows him to participate in high society. On one critical day in his late teens, his heritage is revealed, and despite all his time and love for the family, he is excommunicated and sent back out on his own again. It is then, in his lowest moment, that he turns his pain into vengeance and rises as the defacto leader of the outer city, and becomes the active shadow of revolution. Using his ties to his insider friend, they begin inciting unrest in the outer city, and infighting amongst the inner city. Their plan to drive a violent revolution will be perfectly capped when the leaders of the two factions declare a truce, and rule the peace side-by-side, both extremes of the city equally represented.
### Missions
*Caius main influence on the story is exposing Jaeson to the world through missions for* the cause. *They start off right down his alley, exciting and inspirational, but they become progressively more demanding, until he eventually finds himself obligated to put the people he cares about in harm's way*
- **Graffiti Campaign**: A test to see if Jaeson will break some rules for the sake of the cause. Caius gets Jaeson to paint some symbols of rebellion, representative of the oppression placed on the outer city. Jaeson loves the act of rebellion, and is glad he is finally able to use his skills to cause some change. He gets a few of his friends to play along.
- **Covert Deliveries**: Jaeson is tasked with following a *very* specific route to drop off a sealed package that must not be opened until delivery. Jaeson, leading his small band of rebels, feels empowered to take his own, "better" route. His hubris gets him in a pinch, but his quick wit and natural leadership get him and his buddies out, mostly unscathed.
- **Information Gathering**: He's tasked with gathering intel from the inner city. Using his charm and wits, he and a select few colleagues infiltrate a private gala as waiters. It's exciting and makes him feel like a spy as he moves around the room, collecting info and coordinating with the other "waiters". *We discover some very important background information during these interactions* (A friend may or may not be lost during this event)
- **Campaign Sabotage**: Caius takes Jaeson on a mission to sabotage minor inner city operations (replace campaign material with slander?). During this night mission, Caius discovers Jaeson has the Sight when he stops Caius from walking around a wall in the path of an approaching guard. Caius takes him down with a "non-lethal" tool. When he remains motionless on the way out, Jaeson has his doubts. (this will likely be combined with the previous mission)
- **Shieldwall Sabotage**: Finally, with key information acquired, he is given the same delivery mission as before, but this time is ordered to open the contents of the package upon reaching his destination. Instructions will be in the box. When he arrives, he discovers that his mission is to impersonate an engineer and trigger critical weaknesses planted over time. Jaeson's conscience screams at him not to do it, but the rationalization given by Varro, and the peer pressure of the other crew members watching over him causes him to lay the final blow. As he walks away, the shield wall collapses, and he feels the warm rush of wind at his back. He shivers.
- **Recruitment**: Jaeson is tasked with putting up posters and giving speeches aimed at capturing the attention of the desperate members of the outer city, preparing them for the inevitable revolution. But as he stands on his soap box and looks around at the other kids his age, his conscience harasses him about his accessory to a murder, and the façade of heroism holding back all his unruly emotions collapses, and he runs home to escape his demanding obligations.
# The Three Big Character Questions
1. What does your main character want more than anything in the world?
	1. Power and a sense of control in a crazy world.
2. What major flaws (internal problems) and obstacles (external problems) will stand in their way? What virtues (internal aid) and support (external aid) will help them?
	1. (internal) He believes the world operates on merit, and vastly underestimates the power of nepotism.
	2. (external) The system simply doesn't care about his ideals.
3. Will your character achieve what they want? Will they change significantly over the course of the story? Why or why not?
	1. He will not get what he wants. This character is basically a tale of warning not to see things through rose-y glasses.

## Scenes
- Lean into "Join me" villian trope. Introduce Caius earlier on in the story as a pretty nasty dude (through Siel's perspective). When Jaeson encounters him and initiates the offer to join, the audience is screaming 'NO!', but from Jaeson's perspective, he has a lot to gain, and nothing to lose
