# The Three Big Character Questions

- **What does your main character want more than anything in the world**?
	- To help her family's failing condenser shop from being crushed by declining economic conditions
- **What major flaws (internal problems) and obstacles (external problems) will stand in their way? What virtues (internal aid) and support (external aid) will help them**?
	- Flaws: She is young enough to think she knows everything, but old enough to have cultural mentalities settled in.
	- Obstacles: Overcoming her hard earned knowledge on how to build condensers
	- Virtues: Her tenacity and ability to lock into the flow state at will
	- Support: 
- **Will your character achieve what they want? Will they change significantly over the course of the story? Why or why not**?

## Scenes that demonstrate personality
- Predisposition for Aesthemancy
	- Siel has blueprints for many different prototypes littering her room
