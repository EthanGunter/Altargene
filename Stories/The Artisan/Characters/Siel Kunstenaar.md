# The Three Big Character Questions

- What does your main character want more than anything in the world?
	- To help her family's failing condenser shop from being crushed by declining economic conditions
- What major flaws (internal problems) and obstacles (external problems) will stand in their way? What virtues (internal aid) and support (external aid) will help them?
	- Flaws: She is young enough to think she knows everything, but old enough to have cultural mentalities settled in.
	- Obstacles: Overcoming her hard earned knowledge on how to build condensers
	- Virtues: 
	- Support: 
- Will your character achieve what they want? Will they change significantly over the course of the story? Why or why not?
