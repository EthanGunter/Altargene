Jaeson is a young revolutionary. A true punk. He intuitively understands legend. He loves his stories, and likes to take advantage of things that happen to him to appear like the characters of old (much like Kvothe)
Jaeson is a hypersensitive sensory type. He can see people by their energy. This sight is layered on top of his normal vision, and is only obstructed by other energies (he can see through non-living walls) 
- *"How did you know he was there?" Jaeson cocked an eyebrow, "I saw him coming..." "But that's not possible, there was a wall in the way!" Jaeson chuckled, "Walls don't glow silly"*
	- It would be an interesting plot point if this is why [[Caius Varro|Jaeson's "mentor"]] takes an interest in him, who finds it out while Jaeson is being interrogated in custody in the beginning of the book. This would make Jaeson an inactive witness, hardly able to get himself out of the situations he is commanded in to.
# The Three Big Character Questions
1. **What does your main character want more than anything in the world**?
	- To break free from the constraints of his society and make a real impact, much like the legendary figures he admires.
2. **What major flaws (internal problems) and obstacles (external problems) will stand in their way? What virtues (internal aid) and support (external aid) will help them**?
	- **Flaws**: His youthful naivety and tendency to romanticize rebellion could lead to dangerous situations.
	- **Obstacles**: Societal structures, the influence of his "mentor," and his lack of experience in the real world.
	- **Virtues**: His intuition, ability to read energies, and inherent bravery.
	- **Support**: His sister Siel's guidance, his unique ability to see energies, and allies he might find in his revolutionary pursuits.
4. **Will your character achieve what they want? Will they change significantly over the course of the story? Why or why not?**
	- He won't get the wide reform that he seeks, but he grow in leaps and bounds, and will become the seed of a budding rebellion that might be explored in future books.

- **Defining gestures/movements**: Grooms his hair with his hands whenever he is in deep thought. Looks around with exaggerated coolness when in anxious conversation

- **Hobbies/interests**: Music, street art, and exploring urban legends
- **Special skills/abilities**: Has *the sight*. He can see energies, enabling him to get fast reads on people, and see through walls, but in some cases makes his natural sight much more difficult to use (i.e. computer screens are a nightmare)

## Scenes that demonstrate personality
- Desire to see others excel
	- Jaeson steals one of Siel's blueprints and tries to get someone to help bring it to fruition. It ends up in someone else's possession (somehow) and Siel doesn't find out until she sees her design in person
- Eager to fill the boots of his heroes
	- Caius tells Jaeson that he is a leader, despite having demonstrated no leadership qualities. Jaeson prematurely runs a mission (on his own) with his leader's chest puffed high, where he fails miserably. By the end of the book, he manages to learn the true nature of leadership, and redeems himself
