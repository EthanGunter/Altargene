*An ex-[[The Council|council]] member responsible for water purification and keeping citizens inside the city walls. He defected to the high jungle where no one could follow him, where he honed his skills with [[Setting#Magic|aestheturgy]] and built himself a cozy little corner of the world. He becomes Siel's reluctant mentor, and through their time together decides it's best to leave his life of solitude and help fix the world he helped build*
Altus is the father of Caius' friend.

1. What does your main character want more than anything in the world?

3. Will your character achieve what they want? Will they change significantly over the course of the story? Why or why not?
