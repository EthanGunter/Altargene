*An ex-[[The Council|council]] member responsible for water purification and keeping citizens inside the city walls. He defected to the high jungle where no one could follow him, where he honed his skills with [[Setting#Magic|aestheturgy]] and built himself a cozy little corner of the world. He becomes Siel's reluctant mentor, and through their time together decides it's best to leave his life of solitude and help fix the world he helped build*
# The Three Big Character Questions

1. What does your main character want more than anything in the world?
	1. To be free of the guilt of manipulating and extorting an entire planet worth of people
2. What major flaws (internal problems) and obstacles (external problems) will stand in their way? What virtues (internal aid) and support (external aid) will help them?
	1. Altus solves his problem by running away to live in the jungle, rather than facing and fixing the problem head on. Siel's detailing of life in the city, and his time helping her restores hope in him and spurs him to go back and fight the council.
3. Will your character achieve what they want? Will they change significantly over the course of the story? Why or why not?
