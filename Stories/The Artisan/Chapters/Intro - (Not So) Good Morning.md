"What do you mean 'You can't buy any more condensers'? We've kept this shipment steady for 3 years!"
"I'm sorry Siel, it's just not in the books for us. Our shelves are stocked full and I'd be putting the business in jeopardy if I kept buying them."
"It's not my fault you don't know how to make sales. Put them in the windows, do a promotion. Hell, if you can't do it yourself, hire someone else to market them! We make the best condensers in all of Dusthaven, and I'm not going to let our family's lives go to risk because you don't know how to show people that."
"Hey now! We don't hire numbskulls, and we do everything we can day in and day out to make sales. You're not the only one fighting an uphill battle here. It's not a marketing issue, I just don't know how else to say it; no one wants Kundensers anymore"
"What?" Siel could feel her body knotting. "How are people going to _ _ _ _ _ ? You're %not making sense Kiyran%."
"Beats me kiddo. The numbers don't say much, but they sure don't lie. People aren't buying"
Siel couldn't take it anymore. A primal sound began to rattle its way from behind her breast bone as she leaned forward and slammed a fist on the counter. "I don't know how long you think I'm going to..."
"Listen" Kiyran cut her off, "I'll buy 3 of the ones you've already made, at the usual price, and I'll let you know when I'm running low again. In the mean time, just take it easy."
Siel's words caught in her chest. "I - I can't just "*take it easy*" Kiyran! Food doesn't fall from the sky!" But Kiyran was already arranging numbers on his terminal. He motioned to a burly man sitting near the warehouse door. A wave, three fingers, and a point towards Siel's lev-cart. She stared through the counter, a million thoughts competing for the crowded space in her head.
*3 condensers at 120 apiece will only net us 360 bits. Barely enough to cover materials for the next batch. We could probably cut some corners, shorten the thermal coil... Ahh what am I saying? It wouldn't matter anyway. There's no point in making more of what we can't sell in the first place. Oh god, how are we going to cover rent? Grandpa's stabilizers aren't cheap, and Jaeson's tuition...*
A beep on Siel's arm stole her consciousness from its rumination. 400 bits. She stared blankly at Kiryan, her head slightly cocked in confusion. He held her eyes for a moment, sharing a sad, knowing smile, then left to help shelve the new merchandise he had just bought.
%Siel walks back to the family house, thinking to herself (filling the audience in) about the current state of Dusthaven, and her current perspective on it%
%Siel gets back home and has some interactions with Jaeson and Grandpa%
	Jaeson is playing games, but has homework to do
	Grandpa is making a condenser, but won't admit how much he is struggling
%Siel gets restless and decides to finish Grandpa's work. She falls into the rhythm of making a condenser. This sequence should be described like dancing, like magic in her head. The flow state%
