# What is a *story*?
Stories are expanded pieces of #lore that center around a *specific individual* and those close to them. Stories detail how a character's actions cause change in the world they live in, in one way or another.
# Why is a story?
There are many things that stories are good for, but if we consider their ultimate form, stories are a vessel for generations to pass the fundamental wisdoms of life into the future. The only way to truly gain insight is through experience, and stories provide a unique medium for people to easily and safely gain experiences second hand. In a way, we as authors are curators of artificial memories, and we have the power to indirectly steer the lives that our readers live, for better, or for worse. I would argue that, given such power, we have a duty to our readers to equip them with the best insights that we have at our disposal, showing them through our characters how to deal with the various hardships that life throws our way, and how to strive for a better future despite the struggle of it all.

# Steps to create a new story:
1. Fill out (at least partially) a character questionnaire for the primary character
	- Without this knowledge of the character, the story will fall flat.
2. Give your story a descriptive title (at least a working title)
	- Without a title, stories will get mixed up, lost, and cluttered.
3. INSERT SOMETHING ABOUT OUTLINING PLOT AND STARTING THE WORLD BUILDING PROCESS

# Progress Tips
1. Create concrete names *as soon as possible*
	- You can always find-and-replace, but leaving vague names and pronouns as place holders prevents a story from having any substance. You'd be surprised how fast a story comes together when "PROTAGONIST" becomes "Siel Kunstenaar, the artisan".

# Documenting Events
1. If you believe you have the major plot points worked out for your story, go ahead and add a document to the *Worldbuilding and Lore* Directory with the high-level details
	- This allows others who are not intimately familiar with your story to safely build on the canon that you've added, without contradicting, or ignoring significant concepts that would affect their own additions.
