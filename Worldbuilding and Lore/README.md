# World Building VS Lore
#### World building
is the detailing of interconnected parts of a universe. Species, technologies, locations, magics, etc. 
World building is useful as a reference for constraints and consistency, or to understand what parts of the universe need fleshing out.
#### Lore
is a form of world building that applies a timeline to the universe. It gives specific and unique names to characters and events that have a significant impact on the world after the fact. 
All lore has a story behind it, and so every story added to this repo should also have a lore entry. The reverse may also be true; any lore that does not have a story written for it is fair game (but check around to make sure no one else is working on it first)
