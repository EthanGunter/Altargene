#### Aesthetic Magics
- **Aesthete**: is derived from the Greek word “Aisthētikos”, meaning perception by the senses or sensitive to beauty. They are the creative process literally manifest as magic.
- These magic forms have a strong influence on the living things that encounter them, and behold their design.
##### 1) Aestheturgy (hard/concrete):
- **-urgy**: This suffix is from the Greek “Ergon”, meaning work
	- "Just because it's magic, doesn't mean it isn't hard work!"
	- Built on the philosophy that artwork is 10% inspiration/luck, 90% perspiration
- This form of magic is entirely based around the *refinement* aspect of the creative process. It is a very introspective form of magic that relies on the user to dive into the depths of who they are as a power source.
- The highest form of this magic would behave very similarly to the [fabricate spell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fabricate), except physical contact is still required
- Artifacts
	- Artifacts (artworks) are the physical manifestation of this magic, and are used as a sort of foci to channel an aestheturgist' intention into the world.
		- When an aestheturgist dies, their power goes into all of the artifacts that they've made, empowering them far beyond their original capacity (ancient relics hold unparalleled power over people)
	- Part of the function *is* the form. Artifacts are not merely a tool, but an integrated part of an environment's identity.
	- Artifacts are bound with meaning to their Creator, and their intended user. How this plays out depends on how the Creator intentions in the object, but the relationship between an item and it's user is very real and very tangible. (A shattered vase could take someone's breath away and knock them to the ground, or an amulet could give it's wearer unparalleled will power while held)
		- This connection can be created or strengthened after the item's construction if enough time, or significant events bind them (sentimentality)
- Real world counterparts: metal workers, architects, painters
##### 2) Aesthemancy (soft/flexible):
- A sister practice to Aestheturgy, Aesthemancy instead focuses on the *generative* aspects of creativity
- **-mancy**: a method of divination
	- "How does he do it?"
- This form of magic is entirely based around the *generative* aspect of the creative process. It is a very fast-paced, situation based magic that relies on quick wit and powerful belief.
- Real world counterparts: dancers, comedians, actors, public speakers
#### Luminaries
A very important item in Auspex culture, luminaries act as a channeling device for wearers to channel their intentions into the physical dimension.
- Getting a luminary is a right of passage in Auspex culture, and while there is no known upper bound to the number a person can acquire, most struggle to handle more than one
- Each luminary
#### Sight
A very rare form of magic that is passed by bloodlines, and not very well understood. It manifests in different forms for different gifted beings, but the most common shared trait is the ability to see extended forms of energy
- The observable energy is not a participant of the electro-magnetic spectrum, and as such can not be simulated by the most common forms of imaging technologies
- This is mainly listed here to suggest some ancient Auspex artifacts may display information and have controls that can only be used by those with Sight, and the means to manipulate that energy
