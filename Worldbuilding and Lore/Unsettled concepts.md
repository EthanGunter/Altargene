#### The Solar system is not empty when humans arrive...
- Mars is populated by a less sophisticated, and far more aggressive species that welcomes their guests with open arms (not in the hugging sense).
- A war ensues resulting in the destabilization of Mars, and the destruction of most of the advanced technology that came from Genesis.
- A portal to Earth is opened by an Architect, and the few remaining members of each species escape to Earth before Mars becomes entirely uninhabitable.
- Cross breeding occurs, and the human race, as we know it, begins. *Most* of history as it's told in textbooks takes place, except:
	- The development of homosapiens is compressed as a bunch of coexisting branches of the Genesis-Martian bloodlines diverge
	- There is a small group of Genesians that effectively form a cult which keeps the secrets of Genesian technology alive, and away from the hands of those with Martian genetics.
		- This pure-blood Genesis species is what modern humans think of as aliens, and while they don't have the ability to safely leave Earth, they do have technology advanced enough to monitor the growing populations of Earth, and try to steer them from destroying what seems to be their last chance at a home.

#### Architects
- Less of a species, and more of a conceptual group, Architects are beings that have developed near mastery of the physical plane
- While their power was earned via means of exceptional effort, and not bestowed upon them like many gods of lore, the time scale of their existence and their aloofness to the goings-on of "mortals" makes them appear as though they will always be, and have always been who/what they are
- Earth, at the time of the arrival of the Genesians, is a veritable paradise. A playground for the Architects.
	- Maybe the Architects found the Martians on Earth first, and moved them to Mars so they could shape Earth, uninhibited?
- After the Genesians and Martians escape to Earth, the Architects become the subject of worship. And of study. Steve/Katt is amongst the protectors of Genesian technology, and wants to expand their knowledge.
	- Things start out as an alliance, and the faithful Architect that helped them escape Mars helps guide the fledgling beings to stability on Earth. With such advanced guidance, they build cities powered by pyramids, transform vast swathes of desert into arable farm land, and produce large varieties of technologies that enhance life at both a macro, and micro scale.
	- After the Architect sends them out to the corners of the Earth to replicate what has been done in Sumer, Steve/Katt gets greedy, and seeks to understand how to achieve god-hood itself. He begins a campaign that sees every remaining Architect on Earth killed, captured and dissected, or forced to flee, leaving nothing but memories cut into the Earth itself (and setting up modern day Earth to exist as we know it)
