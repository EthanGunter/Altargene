#worldbuilding #lore 
A small collection of passages written by the spiritual founder of the Auspex %AUSPEX_FOUNDER%. It is the foundation of Auspex society, and serves as their guiding light in times of uncertainty.

# The Litany
A ritual series of chants (similar to the 10 commandments) that every member of the Auspex Empire is expected to recite from memory by the time they reach age 10. It lists the fundamental beliefs of the Auspex Empire.
# The Exhortation
The passage from the Uhrison that is quoted most often. It is a plea to those who read the Uhrison to have faith in it, and to protect the power within from the outside world, which seeks to corrupt, dilute and dismantle. It is common to find lyrics from this passage proudly integrated into paintings, architecture, and designs of all kinds.
# The Cadence
A collection of psalms shared only within the most powerful members of society. Properly performing different verses from The Cadence enables practitioners to wield great magic.
# The Elegy
A warning on the dangers of using the magic herein for personal gains. This section was removed during the reign of %AUSPEXIAN_NAME%, resulting in the first Great House War.
# The Benediction
Initially meant as a brief blessing to disciples of The Way, the Benediction is most often spoken over warriors by their leaders just before they head into battle.


#### Read Me
Rather than write the Uhrison in it's entirety, simple quotes and verses from the text will suffice. Feel free to add anything that seems on-brand with %AUSPEX_FOUNDER%, and the section you're adding it too.  
There is also precedence for adding entirely new sections under the pretense that they are "long lost", or intentionally hidden by someone along the way.
