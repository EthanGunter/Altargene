### Genesis
*The largest company in the known universe, Genesis revolutionized planetary colonization post-Exodus. It was formed by the heads of three industry-families -Mining/Resources, Construction, and Transportation- when the extinction threat of the Nexus became undeniable. Forced collaboration combined their expertise to efficiently transport and establish a self-sufficient civilization's-worth of people to a distant star system. Following this successful collaboration, the family-heads of those industries formed the conglomerate Genesis, which now provides premium colonization services to the elite of the Alliance, marking the foundation of the Age of Expansion/Exploration.*
