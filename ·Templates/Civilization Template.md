#### Method of Control: TODO
*Terror, making participation desirable, making the outside undesirable (propaganda), allowing self-governance ("nothing" changes), an appeal to sovereignty (rightful ruler), assimilation (unified culture)*
#### Communication Ability: TODO
*Speed and Volume of communication is vital for effective coordination. Faster communication enables centralized power, slower communication necessitates decentralized power structures.*
#### Transportation Ability: TODO
*Similar to communication, the ability to transport physical materials enables a central power to maintain control by keeping colonies well fed and respond quickly with troops, but it also heavily influences the growth potential of its economy.*
#### Economy: TODO
*A healthy economy is an indicator of stability. Wider markets make participation in a civilization more appealing than closed off and smaller civilizations.
Successful empires often help protect property rights*
#### Most Enforced Laws: TODO
*Legal enforcement is an indicator of priority in a civilization. It tells a story of the past, as well as how much power is in the hands of the people.*
#### Significant Historical Changes: TODO
*Any long-standing civilizations will undergo noticeable changes in economy, politics, religion, and ultimately culture. Including indicators to these changes, like architectural remnants, statues, or derelict technologies that have been awkwardly built around can make your civilization much more believable.*
#### Challenges posed by key magics/technologies: TODO
*Any civilization full of people with a unique ability is going to have a significantly different way of handling certain things. What do people no longer have to do? What are people enabled to do that might cause trouble for the civilization at large? What accommodations have they made to keep things in order?*
